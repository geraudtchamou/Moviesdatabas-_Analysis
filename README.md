Programming for data science nonodegree - Project I

## Overview
In this project, you will query the Sakila DVD Rental database. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, you will be querying the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance. 
## Tool needed to accomplish the task

To accomplish the project, I will be using:

Notepad++ as a text editor 
SQL terminal window (provided by Udacity Platform)

## Main questions to answers

Q1:  We want to estimate both the market demand and the available inventory of the DVD renting business?
Q2:  Who are our top 10 paying customers?
Q3: We want to investigate the movies that families like?
Q4: We want to investigate the behavior of customers by looking at how they deal with renting due date?
